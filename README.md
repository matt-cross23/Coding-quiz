# Coding-quiz
This project's intention was to tests the coder's knowledge of JavaScript and each component of the quiz was a thought exercise to help the coder solve problems logically through JS and apply the coding. I struggled with aspects of the project and did not complete the assignment fully but was able to learn a lot and become more familiar with JS.
